#QAP2 QUESTIONS
---------------

How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

Answer: This one took me much longer than the previous one, I would easily say I spent 20 hours working on this assessment doing a few hours a night before spending 6 hours Friday night and 6 hours Saturday night then just a couple extra hours Sunday to finish and polish/review. 


What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

Answer: I ended up rewatching the lecture concerning getters and setters, made use of stackoverflow and I have saved the cheatsheet posted on princeton universitys website. 


Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Answer: No, our group chat was fairly quiet this time around no one even made a 'how is everyone finding it?' type post.




Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

Answer: No.




Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

Answer: Problem 1 and 2 I understood fairly well and would say not difficult. Where I sunk lots of time was problem 3, there was a lot to sort of create and do AND I found the big block of text of instructions a little hard to read and follow. A similar problem I would probably still need to sink time into to complete I do not think I could get it done any faster.
